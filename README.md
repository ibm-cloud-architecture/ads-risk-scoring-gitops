# Automation Decision Service Risk Scoring demo gitops

This GitOps repository defines the deployment of a simple risk scoring solution which includes

* A Quarkus app to enter loan value, and is a client of the decision service
* A ADS decision service to score the loan risk

## Pre-requisites

We need to have:
* OpenShift 4.7+
* OpenShift GitOps operator deployed or use the command

  ```sh
  oc apply -k https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/eda-gitops-catalog/openshift-gitops-operator/overlays/stable
  ```
* OpenShift Pipelines operator deployed or use the command

  ```sh
  oc apply -k https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/eda-gitops-catalog/openshift-pipelines-operator/overlays/
  ```

## How this was set up

* This GitOps repository was created with [KAM](https://github.com/redhat-developer/kam) with a command like

```sh
kam bootstrap \
--service-repo-url https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/credit-origination-app \
--gitops-repo-url  https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/ads-risk-scoring-gitops \
--image-repo quay.io/ibm-cloud-architecture/credit-origination-app \
--output ads-risk-scoring-gitops \
--prefix ads-risk-scoring --push-to-git=true \
--git-host-access-token <a-github-token> \
```

* Then from the credit-origination-app , we moved the service, deployment and  route declaration generated by the
Quarkus OpenShift plugin to the `environment/ads-risk-scoring-dev/apps/services/credit-origination-app/base/config` folder as

```
├── 100-deployment.yaml
├── 200-service.yaml
├── 300-route.yaml
└── kustomization.yaml
```

## Bootstrap the CI/CD

* First define the ArgoCD Project named 'risk-scoring'

  ```sh
  oc project  openshift-gitops
  oc apply -f bootstrap/risk-scoring/argo-project.yaml
  ```
*
